# project2
My Project 2 entails my server/client-based system on my Raspberry Pi that transfers collated data between programs and presents it in a GUI format. The project involves developing Python source code files for the client (ClientDWM.py) 
and server (ServerDWM.py), with specific requirements for each. The client is expected to sample vcgencmd data at 2-second intervals, send 50 iterations of the data set to the server, and feature a simple GUIinterface with connection indicators
and an Exit button. The server runs on both a Pi and a PC, display 6 values from the JSON object sent by the client in a GUI, and include features like a toggling Unicode LED and an Exit button.
